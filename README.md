# Credit Card Fraud Analysis and Prediction


In this project, I analyzed data on Credit card transactions using data from the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud) platform.  Digital payments are evolving, but so are cyber criminals. According to the Data Breach Index, more than 5 million records are being stolen on a daily basis, a concerning statistic that shows - fraud is still very common both for Card-Present and Card-not Present type of payments.

Using the data, I analyzed factors that correlated with credit card transactions being fraudulent, and did some exploratory visualization and analysis.  I then created a model that predicts the chance that a credit card transaction is Fraudulent or not.  This model could be useful for financial business owners.  You can see the exploratory data analysis in the `analysis.ipynb` notebook above.  

The model can be tested locally using the python script `credit_card_fraud_app.py` also seen above.
